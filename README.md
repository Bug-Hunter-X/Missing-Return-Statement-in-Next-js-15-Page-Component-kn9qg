# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15: a missing `return` statement in a page component.  Next.js 15 is stricter about this, resulting in a runtime error if a page component doesn't explicitly return JSX.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You'll see a runtime error.

## Solution

The solution is to ensure that all page components have a `return` statement that returns valid JSX.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the importance of following best practices and using linters to catch potential errors before runtime.
